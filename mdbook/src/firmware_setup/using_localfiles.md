   REMEMBER the system path you selected in the wizard! You'll be transferring the firmware to that folder.

2. Close the wizard and open your previously picked system path.

   As an example, if you selected your system directory to be `F:/stuff/`, your firmware should be stored inside of `F:/stuff/system`.

   Ensure the folder contains `common, priv, sys, and vsh`.
